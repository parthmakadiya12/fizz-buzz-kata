## Fizz Buz Game

- Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
    - For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
    - For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
    - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

```
1 - 1
2 - 2
3 - Fizz
4 - 4
5 - Buzz
6 - Fizz
7 - 7
8 - 8
9 - Fizz
10 - Buzz
